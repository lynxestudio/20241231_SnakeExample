# A game Snake example

<p align="justify">
Snake is the name for a common computer game concept, with different versions available in arcades, computers and on different platforms for phones or tablets.
The gameplay of a Snake game is very simple. The player controls a straight line (the snake) which they can move around a board using their keyboard. Pieces of fruit or bugs appear in the game over time, and the player is supposed to eat the fruit by moving the snake into them. Every time the player eats a piece of fruit or bug the player scores a point and snake grows, making the game more difficult. The aim of the game is to score as many points as possible without crashing into a wall on the board or your own tail.

The game of Snake was first made popular as an arcade game called Blockade in 1976. The player had to move a character that leaves a solid black line behind it around the screen, using four buttons to decide the direction. The aim was to avoid hitting an opponent.

The popularity of Blockade led to lots of companies creating their own versions. Well-known ones include <em>Worm</em>, Nibbler and Rattle Race. By far the most famous version, which was called Snake, came for free on Nokia mobile phones in 1998. It was so popular that Nokia created multiple versions of increasing sophistication and complexity. Snake 2, released on the Nokia 3310, is the best-known.
